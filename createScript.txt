Create a Python script in the current directory that will create a simple tree diagram of all files in the current directory (except for .git, dist, build, node_modules, any .egg-info directory, and any __pycache__ directory).

This python script should be named create_directory_diagram.py and should save the diagram into a file named directory_structure, if that file doesn't exist.

Use the following example as a rough guide for the output this script should produce:

your-package-name/
├── your_package_name
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── your_script.py
├── setup.py
└── README.md
